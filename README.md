Answer digital technical tasks

The tests run in mocha with a timeout of 15000.

You will need to have nodejs installed, mocha, selenium webdriver, chrome driver and geckodriver.

Hello please find here my automated tests for Answer Digital Technical tasks.
task1 is temperamental. I wish I could work out why some tests work in chrome and not in firefox, and then ones that don't work in chrome work in firefox, but then sometimes they work fine without having changed anything.

All the best
Stephen Campbell
